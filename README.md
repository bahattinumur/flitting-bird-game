<h1>FLITTING BIRD GAME</h1>

I've created a flitting bird game using JavaScript. Press 'Enter' to start the game. Every time you press the up arrow key, the bird flaps its wings. If you keep holding the same key, the bird will glide upwards without flapping. As you fly, navigate through obstacles without hitting them; otherwise, you'll have to start over from the beginning.
